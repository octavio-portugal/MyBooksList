"# MyBooksList" 

This App was made to my study.

The main idea for the MyBooksList is get books information from the New York Times free API, and show in different types of views.

I'm using MVVM architecture and Clean Code rules, to do my structure and the code more easily to understand and read.

I built this code using knowledge from courses I done and researches.
